# Git dotfiles

This repository contains baseline `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` files with
configurations applicable to most project. Extend and modify them to support
tools and languages specific to your project.

## The `.gitignore` file

The `.gitignore` file has been generated on [Toptal's .gitignore
generator][gitignore.io], and ignores common files generated by:

- Windows
- Linux
- Visual Studio Code

To update the `.gitignore` file to exclude generated tools for the tools and
languages specific to your application, navigate to
<https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore?templates=linux,windows,visualstudiocode>
and use the generator to create a new `.gitignore` file.

## The `.gitattributes` file

The `.gitattributes` file was introduced to manage file endings (`CRLF`/`LF`) on
files pushed to the repository. Specifically, the
[`Common.gitattributes`][gitattributes-source] file from the
[alexkaratarakis/gitattributes][gitattributes-repo] repository is used as a
baseline, which sets many other attributes, including appropriate line endings
for common file types.

Specifically, the provided `.gitattributes` file:

- auto detects text files and performs LF normalization
- explicitly declares common files as either text and binary
- explicitly declares known OS-specific files as ending with CRLF or LF
- converts complex file types to text (doc, pdf, etc) before a diff
- ignore the .gitignore and .gitattribute files when exporting the repo
